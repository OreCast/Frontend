### OreCast tasks

- Ask for some data, and put it to s3, then test fetching this data and streaming.
- Add mongodb to meatada
- Move common data structs from services to common/data
  - for instance, the client and Frontend re-use Site/MetaData structs
  and therefore we need to put them into common place
- move common functions to common/utils or common/tools, e.g.
  - httpGet, httpPost
- Add Google map to main page with site icon, the sites info should come from metadata which should supply geo locations (PARTIALLY DONE]
  - need Google API key for that which requires credit card on file with Google
- Add storage endpoint to create bucket and upload data [PARTIALLY DONE]
- Decide on common icon style and define all images
- Switch to restful endpoints, eg /storage/Cornell/bucket, add http delete, put, post methods to it [DONE]
- add proper cookies and session store, see
  [document](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66289603/use-existing-session-cookie-in-gin-router)
